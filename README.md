# CamperVan, a Campfire to IRC bridge

## Features

CamperVan, as far as your IRC client is concerned, is just another ircd.

Campfire rooms and users are mapped as IRC channels and nicks. Campfire
messages, even custom ones such as tweets and sounds, are translated
for an IRC client to understand.

## Mappings

Wherever possible, Campfire messages and IRC commands are translated
bidirectionally. Some of the mappings are:

    IRC                         Campfire
    ---                         --------
    #day_job                    "Day Job" room
    joe_bob (nick)              Joe Bob (user)
    @admin_user (nick)          An admin user
    "joe_bob: hello" (message)  "Joe Bob: hello" (message)
    https://tweet_url           Tweet message
    /me waves                   *waves*

    /LIST                       List rooms
    /JOIN #day_job              Join the "Day Job" room
    /PART #day_job              Leave the "Day Job" room
    /WHO #day_job               List users in "Day Job"

    /MODE +i #day_job           Lock room
    /MODE -i #day_job           Unlock room

    /TOPIC #day_job new topic   Change room's topic to "new topic"

## Usage

### Installation

    gem install camper_van

### Command-line Options

    camper_van --help

### Running CamperVan

    camper_van

From your IRC client, set up a connection to `localhost:6667`. To authenticate
with Campfire, you must configure your connection's password (the IRC PASS
command) to be:

    campfire_subdomain:api_key

Connect, and `/LIST` will show you the IRC channels / campfire rooms you
have access to. To connect to more than one subdomain, make a separate
connection for each.

Your campfire subdomain should be just the subdomain part. If your campfire url
is `mycompany.campfirenow.com`, the subdomain would be `mycompany`.

CamperVan supports multiple simultaneous connections. Simply open a new
connection and use `other_subdomain:other_api_key` for authentication.

If your IRC client (mIRC) doesn't allow `:` in the password, you can use `-`.
